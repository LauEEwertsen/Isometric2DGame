# Isometric2DGame â€“ Internship Trial Project

This Unity project was created as part of a 5-day programming trial for a game development internship.

The project includes:
- Unity 2D URP setup
- GitHub integration with proper version control practices
- Isometric player movement using Unity's Input System
- Enemy AI using a state machine (Idle, Patrol, Chase, Attack)
- One specialization: a basic combat system

Each task was completed in a dedicated Git branch, with regular commits and clear messages. The final version was merged into the `main` branch after testing and polish.
